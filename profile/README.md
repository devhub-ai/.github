Students from colleges and universities often face significant challenges when it comes to finding peers with similar interests, skills, and knowledge for collaboration on projects, hackathons, and other academic or extracurricular activities. This difficulty in connecting with like-minded individuals can hinder their ability to form effective teams, share knowledge, and achieve their full potential in these activities.

we aim to address these challenges by providing a comprehensive platform where students can easily find and connect with peers who share their interests and possess complementary skills. By leveraging advanced AI technology, DevHub-AI will facilitate intelligent matchmaking and personalized recommendations, ensuring that students can form effective teams and engage in meaningful collaborations. The platform will provide a structured and user-friendly environment for networking, learning, and growth, ultimately enhancing the academic and professional experiences of college students.
